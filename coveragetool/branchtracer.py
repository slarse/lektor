    are the only ones that will be traced. Tracing works only for conditional
    statements that are contained on a single line. Multi-line statements

    be used to create a BranchTracer directly from a variable amount of
    BranchFinders.

    Tracing is started and stopped with the ``start_trace`` and ``stop_trace``
    methods, which sets and unsets the global trace function using
    ``sys.settrace``.
